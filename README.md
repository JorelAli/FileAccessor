# FileAccessor
A mini class I created to help store objects to a file

FileAccessor is a small class I made to store and retrieve information to a file.

Usage
-----
* Drop [FileAccessor.java](https://github.com/Skepter/FileAccessor/blob/master/FileAccessor/src/io/github/skepter/fileaccessor/FileAccessor.java) into your workspace
* Implement it in whatever class you choose to (See [FileAccessorPlugin.java](https://github.com/Skepter/FileAccessor/blob/master/FileAccessor/src/io/github/skepter/fileaccessor/FileAccessorPlugin.java) for an example where I store blocks placed to a file. When retrieved, sets the blocks to gold)
* Done!

Licence
-------
Do whatever you want with it, as long as you reference this project page (if you want, you don't have to). Go ahead and change the package name, I don't care. Do what you want with it.
